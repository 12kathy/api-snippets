NOTE TO NEXT AUTHOR:

I copied this code sample from ../../../rest/making-calls/example-1. I updated the Python sample to record the outgoing call but we still need to update the other languages.

So you should just need to add an extra argument to each of them.

Thank you! (And please remove this file when you're done)
